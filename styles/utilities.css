/*
 * Utility classes.
 *
 * Modelled on the csscaffold project by robzolkos:
 * https://github.com/robzolkos/csscaffold
 *
 * The `utilities` layer is declared last in index.css, which means any class
 * here will always win over component styles — no need for !important or
 * increased selector specificity. This is the intended escape hatch for
 * one-off overrides and reusable single-property helpers.
 *
 * Rules for adding utilities:
 * - One concern per class (e.g. .sr-only, .mx-auto, .uppercase)
 * - No component-specific logic here — if it only makes sense in one place,
 *   it belongs in that component's CSS file
 * - Add the token to variables.css first if a new colour or value is needed
